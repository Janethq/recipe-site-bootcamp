      </ul>
    <h4> Pea Coating</h4>

  <li>3 cups (360g) frozen peas, thawed</li>
<li>2 tbs creme fraiche</li>
<li>1/4 cup dill leaves</li>
<li>Finely grated zest of 1 lemon</li>
<li>1/4 cup (20g) finely grated parmesan</li>
<li>100g bread, crusts removed</li>
</ul>
    <h4>Dressing</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
<li>50g creme fraiche</li>
<li>50g Kewpie mayonnaise</li>
<li>1/4 cup (60ml) olive oil</li>
<li>2 anchovies, finely chopped</li>
<li>1 tbs Dijon mustard</li>
<li>1 tbs capers (in vinegar), drained and chopped</li>
</ul>
    <h4>Crumbs</h4>
<ul>
  <li>1/2 cup (75g) plain flour</li>
<li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
<li>1 cup (50g) panko breadcrumbs</li>
</ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a medium saucepan of water to the boil. Using a slotted spoon, carefully add eggs to pan, one at a time. Boil for 4 minutes. Transfer the eggs immediately to a bowl of iced water to cool. Once the eggs are cold, peel and set aside.
</li>
      <li>To make the pea coating, place all the ingredients in a food processor and whiz until smooth. Divide the pea mixture into 4 equal portions. Make a cup with the palm of your hand, and press one portion flat. Top with a boiled egg and gently press the pea mixture around the egg to enclose. Repeat with remaining pea mixture and eggs. Chill for 30 minutes to set, or until ready to cook.
</li>
      <li>To make the dressing, whisk together all ingredients until combined. Set aside. Preheat oven grill to high. Brush baguette with the oil and cook for 1-2 minutes on each side until golden and toasted. Set aside.
</li>
      <li>For the crumb, once eggs are set, place the flour, egg and breadcrumbs in 3 separate bowls. Carefully dip one pea-coated egg into the flour to coat, then dip into the egg, then gently press into the crumbs. Transfer to a plate. Repeat with remaining coated eggs.
</li>
      <li>Half-fill a medium saucepan with vegetable oil and heat oil to 180Â°C (a cube of bread will turn golden in 45 seconds when the oil is hot enough). In batches, add the crumbed eggs and cook for 5 minutes or until golden brown all over. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to a plate and sprinkle generously with salt flakes and freshly ground black pepper.
</li>
      <li>When ready to serve, halve the eggs. Place the lettuce, apple, pea shoots, dill and toasted baguette on a serving platter. Top with eggs and drizzle with the dressing. Serve immediately.
