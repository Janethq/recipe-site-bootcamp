    <p>Preparation Time: 1 Hour</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ tsp ginger (grated, with juice)</li>
      <li>¼ onion (1 oz, 30 g)</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp sake</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp water</li>
      <li>454 g boneless, skin-on chicken thighs</li>
      <li>Diamond Crystal kosher salt</li>
      <li>freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp neutral oil (for cooking the chicken)</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp sake (for steaming)</li>
      <li>1 tsp neutral oil (for crisping the chicken skin)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Grate the ginger and add ½ tsp ginger to a large bowl. Next, grate ¼
        onion into the bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        To the same bowl, add the teriyaki sauce ingredients: 1 Tbsp sake, 1
        Tbsp mirin, 1 Tbsp sugar, 2 Tbsp soy sauce, and 2 Tbsp water. Mix
        together well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prick both sides of 454 g boneless, skin-on chicken thighs with a fork
        so it absorbs more flavor. If the thighs are very thick on one side,
        flatten them to an even thickness with a meat mallet/tenderizer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut off the excess skin and fat and lightly season the chicken pieces
        with Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        At this point, you either can go straight to cooking the chicken or
        marinate it for 30 minutes. To marinate, place the chicken pieces in the
        bowl with the teriyaki marinade and coat well. Let sit for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. When the pan is hot, add 1
        Tbsp neutral oil. Remove as much of the marinade as possible from the
        chicken so it gets a nice sear and does not end up steaming in the
        sauce. Place the chicken skin side down in the pan; reserve the teriyaki
        marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook the chicken for 3 minutes. When the fat renders from the skin and
        the skin is golden brown, flip the chicken. Add 2 Tbsp sake to the pan
        and quickly cover with a lid. Steam the chicken over medium-low heat for
        8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Open the lid and transfer the chicken to a plate. Wipe off the excess
        grease from the pan with a paper towel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Put the pan back on the stove over medium heat and add 1 tsp neutral
        oil. Place the chicken back in the pan, skin side down. Brown and crisp
        the skin for an additional minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the chicken so it is now skin side up. Pour the reserved teriyaki
        marinade into the pan. Cook until the sauce is reduced by about half,
        frequently spooning it over the chicken. Once the alcohol from the sake
        and mirin evaporates, you will see the sugar start to crystallize and
        the sauce thicken. Turn off the heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and slice into bite-sized
        pieces.
      </li>
      <li>Serve on a plate and drizzle the remaining pan sauce on top.</li>
